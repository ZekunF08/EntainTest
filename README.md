### Business Requirement:

- Create a single page application that displays 'Next to goâ€™ races using our API.
  A user should see 5 races at all times, and they should be sorted by time ascending.
- Race should disappear from the list after 1 min past the start time (advertised_start).
- User should see meeting name (meeting_name), race number (race_number) and
  countdown timer that indicates the start of the race.
- User should be able to toggle race categories to view races belonging to only the selected category.

### Assumptions:

Here are the assumptions made:

1. The maximum number of races is 10 at one time.
2. The app will display 5 or less when specific category is selected (e.g. user only want to see greyhound games and there is only one match in the next 10 games so user would only see one match displayed)
3. There is no other categories of races in the coming races.

### Install:

1.  Please make sure you have React Native installed
2.  Please make sure you have Yarn or Npm installed
3.  Please make sure you have iOS or Andorid device configured

After run the above code you should see the app running on the device
